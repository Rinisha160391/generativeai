He subsequently appeared in Martin's ''A Clash of Kings'' (1998) and ''A Storm of Swords'' (2000). Through his relationship with Tyrion, Bronn is able to quickly attain great wealth, position, and influence in the royal court of King's Landing.\\n\\nBronn is portrayed by Jerome Flynn in the HBO television adaptation.

The idea of the map was therefore moved into the title sequence.  For the original pilot, the showrunners Benioff and Weiss initially wrote the title sequence as a crow's flight from King's Landing to Winterfell;  however, the production team at Elastic thought the idea was too flat and devised the idea of using 3-D models within a sphere that represents the world of the show.

It received a rating of 54% on Rotten Tomatoes, lower than any previous episode of the show. The eighth episode, \"Hardhome\", received significant praise and was immediately regarded as one of the best episodes in the series. According to \\'\\'Business Insider\\'\\', \"Despite the attacks, \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' remains a steady hit.\"Season 5 featured more significant changes from the novels. Some of the changes were more well-received than others (the sexual assault scene was heavily criticized and caused great controversy). The various plotlines for the season also differed significantly in reception. The Dornish subplot received an overwhelmingly negative reception. In particular, the hyped Sand Snakes were maligned by critics and fans alike, as many found them cheesy and unlikeable. In contrast, Tyrion\\'s storyline was highly praised.
